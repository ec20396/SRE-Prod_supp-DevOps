On **Mac**, some Linux commands are not available by default, such as `netstat -tunlp`. However, you can use alternative methods to achieve the same functionality. Here’s how you can proceed:

### 3. **Check If the Blackbox Exporter is Running**
Instead of using `netstat -tunlp`, you can use these Mac-compatible commands to check the status:

#### **a. Using `lsof` to Check Open Ports**
On Mac, `lsof` (list open files) can be used to see which ports are being used by processes:

```bash
sudo lsof -i -P | grep blackbox_exporter
```

This will show you the processes tied to specific ports and should display the `blackbox_exporter` if it's running.

#### **b. Using `netstat` (Without -tunlp)**
While Mac's `netstat` doesn’t support `-tunlp`, you can still check open ports using the following command:

```bash
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
```

This will show all listening ports, and you can manually verify if the Blackbox Exporter port (usually `9115` by default) is active.

#### **c. Using `ps` to Check Running Processes**
You can also verify if the Blackbox Exporter process is running by checking the process list:

```bash
ps aux | grep blackbox_exporter
```

This will display all processes related to the Blackbox Exporter, including the one running in the background.

### 4. **Check for Active Connections on a Specific Port**
To specifically check if the Blackbox Exporter is running on port `9115` (default for Blackbox Exporter), you can use:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :9115
```

This will show you if the Blackbox Exporter is listening on the expected port.

### Summary of Alternatives:
1. **PWD**: Verify you're in the correct directory using `pwd`.
2. **Run Blackbox Exporter**: Start it with `./blackbox_exporter --config.file=blackbox.yml &> output.log &`.
3. **Check Status**:
   - Use `lsof` to check open ports: `sudo lsof -i -P | grep blackbox_exporter`.
   - Use `netstat` without `-tunlp`: `netstat -an | grep LISTEN`.
   - Use `ps` to verify the process: `ps aux | grep blackbox_exporter`.

These steps should help you ensure that the Blackbox Exporter is running correctly on macOS.
